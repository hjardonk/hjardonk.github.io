    <dt> Mathematical model of a Spiking Phase Locked Loop </dt>
    <dd> A phase-locked loop (PLL) is an input-output system that relates the phase of the output with that of the input in some desired way. There exist several types of PLLs and their applications have been extremely broad. Recently, a new type of PLL has been envisioned: the spiking PLL (sPLL), which plays a fundamental role in the development of innovative Neuromorphic Devices. The aim of the project is to develop a mathematical model, based on ODEs, of an sPLL, which can further be used to aid in the design of neuromorphic devices. This project is in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.rug.nl/research/zernike/bio-inspired-circuits-and-systems/chicca-group/"> Bio-inspired Circuits and Systems research group</a>. </dd>
    <dt> Epidemic model for competing viruses</dt>
    <dd> An important goal of epidemic modeling is to understand the mechanisms that facilitate the spreading of a virus through, say, a human network. Some times, viruses compete between each other for the overall contagion of the desease. The objective is to propose and analyze an epidemic model that camptures such competing dynamics, and propose mechanisms to better control the pread of the multiple viruses.</dd>
    <dt> Interaction of discrete and continuous symmetries in dynamic networks</dt>
    <dd> Within the framework of complex systems, one often considers interacting subsystems within a network. Finite size networks impose some discrete symmetries, while the interacting agents may posees themselves their own symmetries. The objective is to study a particular networked model where both discrete and continuous symmetries interact and to understand how they do so.</dd>
    <dt> Complex patters in multilayer adaptive networks</dt>
    <dd> When subsystems interact within an evolving network, several un-expected patterns may arise. For networks of phase oscillators, one of such patters are the so-called chimera states. In this project multi-layer networks and to ellucidate what are the adaptive mechanisms that give rise to chimeras.</dd>
    <dt> Interaction of different singularites in slow-fast systems</dt>
    <dd> Singularities in slow-fast sustems give rise to complicated phenomena like relaxation oscillations, canards and mixed-mode oscilations. One of the most common singularities is the so-called fold singularity, which indeed can be related to the aforementioned phenomena. In this project we want to understand how folded singularities, and their nerby dynamics, interact with other singularities.</dd>
